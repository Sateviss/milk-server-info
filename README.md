### Launcher
Our server modpack is based on Direwolf20 2.5.0 pack for Minecraft 1.12, and requires at least 4GB of RAM to run
To start playing you must download FTB launcher, either the [official](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/), or the [pirated](https://www.hackphoenix.com/feed-the-beast/) one (we are not responsible for anything if it downloads viruses to your pc, so be careful)
